# Amazone_Clone_Project
Amazon.com clone using HTML and CSS.
Built an Amazon.com clone by utilizing HTML to provide the structure and CSS to specify the design of the web page. It includes header with various sections such Search bar, location, Sign In Features etc. The body includes a hero-section for overall presentation and a shop-section which includes display of various product selections and offers. I furthermore added a footer with different panels including all the copyright details and background information about the page.
I futher intend on developing and improving this project by learning & integrating Javascript into this web page to add various functionalities to build a more accurate and detail oriented clone of amazon.com
